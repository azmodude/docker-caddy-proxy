# docker-caddy-proxy

This is just a temporary repository to build a [caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy) 
Docker image with integrated [caddy-docker-proxy](https://github.com/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy) and
[caddy-dns/digitalocean](https://github.com/caddy-dns/digitalocean) plugins
to make acme work with Digitalocean's DNS.

Once https://github.com/libdns/digitalocean/pull/3 is merged this should go away.
